# Hello

What's your story?

Let's explore that together.

## About Storybook

Storybook is a component library we'll use to communicate the direction of your website or application.
At it's core, the goal of Storybook is to isolate each chunk of functionality in your website into "components", which are essentially widgets.

### How it's used

This storybook is separated into a few main categories, which you can access using the Storybook Sidebar.

- **Documentation** - *Instructions for navigating Storybook, descriptions of goals/features/content*
- **Admin** - *Forms for interacting with site content or data*
- **Demo** - *Configurable "test" area for components and pages*
