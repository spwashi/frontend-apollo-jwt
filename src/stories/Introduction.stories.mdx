# Welcome to your Storybook

Storybook is like a library.

It makes it easier to break down a website into components.

A component is a discrete "chunk" of functionality that enables a user to interact with a feature of your site.

We can use Storybook to talk through the layout, design, and implementation of the site.

We can also test out specific configurations of components to make sure they accomplish all the goals you're shooting for.
